# Ubuntu Legacy Community Care Website - Implementation Guide

## Financial Advisor Assistant (Canadian Tax)

A new page at `/financial-advisor` offers a free chat assistant ("Maple") that
answers plain-language questions about Canadian personal income tax, RRSPs,
TFSAs, FHSAs, CPP/OAS, and credits relevant to seniors (age amount, pension
splitting, GIS, CVITP free tax clinics, etc.).

- **Client:** `client/src/pages/TaxAdvisor.tsx` — streams the assistant's
  reply token-by-token and renders it as Markdown via `streamdown`.
- **Server:** `server/routes/taxAdvisor.ts` — validates the request
  (`shared/chat.ts`) and streams a response from the Anthropic API over
  Server-Sent Events.
- **Knowledge:** `server/lib/canadianTaxKnowledge.ts` holds the system prompt
  with reference figures (2025 tax year, approximate — CRA indexes many of
  these annually, and the assistant is instructed to say so and point users to
  canada.ca or a professional).

**Setup:** copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Without
it, the page still loads but shows a friendly "not configured yet" message
instead of erroring.

> Note: this repository's `client/`, `server/`, and `shared/` source folders
> were not present when this guide's other pages (Home, About, Programs,
> Donate, etc. — described below) were originally built; only a minimal Home
> page and this new Financial Advisor page currently exist. The rest of the
> site described in this guide will need to be restored from its original
> source or rebuilt separately.

## Overview

This website has been built to incorporate the software recommendations from the nonprofit management analysis, creating a modern, functional platform that integrates with free and cost-effective tools.

## Design Philosophy

**Theme: Warm Community Connection**

- **Color Palette**: Warm earth tones (browns, terracotta, ochre) with lime green accents (#C8D900) representing the Ubuntu philosophy
- **Typography**: Playfair Display (elegant serif for headings) + Inter (clean sans-serif for body)
- **Layout**: Asymmetric sections with depth, overlapping elements, and organic shapes
- **Signature Elements**: Circular motifs representing interconnectedness, warm gradients, cultural patterns
- **Interaction**: Smooth transitions, inviting hover effects
- **Animation**: Gentle fade-ins and subtle scale transforms
